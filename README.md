# MERO
 MERO (Multiple Excitation of Rare Occurrence) is a statistical test generation algorithm for hardware Trojan detection. It works by repeatedly generating test patterns that excite rare logic conditions at internal nodes of the circuit. This increases the probability of triggering a Trojan, if one is present.
